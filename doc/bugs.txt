Cave Converter Bug Tracker
--------------------------
20150807-1 Status: OPEN
The Survex parser throws an index out of bounds error when given a Survex file which only includes *includes and *equates lines.

The JTree implementation returns dummy legs used to hold LRUD data and then misses off legs at the end of the series because the jTree getChild method in the CaveSurvey class looks up the leg by index from the legs array in a series. The implementation of LRUD data stored for terminal 'to' stations using dummy legs needs to be changed so these are not included in the primary legs array. A unit test for the getChild method should be added with a test case involving a series with LRUD calculated from splays using the leapfrog example case in the test helper class to confirm this has been fixed.

Data model does not support back sights on legs, so passage generation in Survey comes out with duplicated data. Once for a chain of forward legs, and again for a chain of back legs. The terminal station gets zero width and height. See DryWayStream PocketTopo export in Swildons as an example.

PocketTopo txt export files which contain station names that are numbers without a dot in them are not read by the converter. (Work around: Station names need to be of the form 1.2 rather than just 1)

20170213-2 Status: UNTESTED
PocketTopo txt export files can contain fixed stations (e.g.    1041     292006.00    1891849.00    247.00 ) which are not supported in the reader code. These may be ignored or may cause the file not to be read.

On French language OS computers, the Survex writer uses the comma as a decimal seperator in data files, which are not read by Survex.

20180118-2 Status: OPEN
Data read from Compass format files can contain spaces in survey names. These spaces are retained in the names when writing Survex format data, but the resulting files are not valid so Survex does not process them. The spaces need to be replaced with a supported character in Survex output (suggest using underscore).

20180404-1 Status: OPEN
The GUI version of the converter defaults to the JAR file folder for saving files, rather than the file which contained the data last read. So when converting from PocketTopo to Survex you have to first browse to the folder containing the txt file in the Open File dialog, and then navigate back to that folder to save the Survex data file somewhere sensible. Suggest options to default the save path to match the last open path used, or to remember the last open and save paths separately so converting lots of files using different input and output directories allows open and save to always point to the last used folder in each context.
